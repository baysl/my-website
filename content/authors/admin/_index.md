Growing up with my father and brother being IT engineers, I've always been interested by new technology and been up to date with it. When I was 19, I started my apprenticeship in business computing in Fribourg, Switzerland. I graduated after three years, and my final work was focused on network security and basic attacks on computer and smartphone.

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree in telecommunication engineering. Next year, I am going to work on two semester projects and my Bachelor projects. For now, I don't know what theme they will cover, but I hope it is going to be either netowrking or IT security.
