  This was my project at the end of my apprenticeship.


  The first part of it was to analyse the history of computer viruses and attacks. Then, I created a virtual network on VMWare. I had two main PCs : a Windows 10 one, which was the "victim", and a Kali Linux one, which was the "attacker". 


  I ran a few tests and attacks to prove the points made during the analysis.


  I will talk about this projet more in details later. This website is still under construction.
